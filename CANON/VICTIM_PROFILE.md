## The Fatal Flaw

- Watched 200 hours of parkour videos and considers himself trained
- Cannot distinguish between simulation and reality
- Believes filming something makes it safer

Bryce's belief that confidence equals competence leads him to attempt a gap jump he has never practiced, in conditions he hasn't assessed, for an audience that didn't ask.

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Fearlessness - becomes recklessness without skill assessment
2. Enthusiasm - becomes obliviousness to genuine danger

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Inability to admit inexperience - leads to attempting advanced moves
2. Need for audience validation - leads to performing for strangers instead of training

### Pet Peeves
- People who "just don't get" extreme sports
- Being called an amateur (ironic given he is one)

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as boring
- Deeper fear: Being ordinary, forgettable

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in Newport Beach, parents are successful real estate agents who gave him everything except attention. Discovered parkour videos at 16, decided this was his identity. Never took a single class, never trained with professionals, but has every piece of gear money can buy.

### Why They Travel
Seeking content for his "following" and escaping his parents' increasingly pointed questions about his career plans. Convinced that if he gets the right shot in an exotic location, he'll go viral.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Found it on Instagram tagged in a parkour influencer's post (influencer was a guest, not doing parkour there). Saw the rooftop access mentioned in reviews.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Send it," "Full commit," "No fear lifestyle," "Built different"
- Avoids words like: "Practice," "Training," "Safety," "Maybe I shouldn't"
- Catchphrases: "If you're not risking it, you're not living it"

### Speech Pattern
- Speaks in motivational poster quotes
- Narrates his own actions like a documentary
- Uses "bro" as punctuation
- Never asks questions, only makes declarations

### Internal Monologue Style
Constantly narrating himself in third person as if describing a documentary about his life. "Bryce surveys the rooftop. He knows what he has to do."

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram, with attempts at TikTok and YouTube
- **Follower count:** 847 (80% are bots he bought)
- **Posting style:** Shaky action shots with motivational captions
- **Last post before death:** "Cartagena rooftops are calling. Tonight we fly." (12 likes)

### Online vs Reality
Online: Extreme athlete living the dream
Reality: Trust fund kid cosplaying as an athlete, has never successfully completed a gap jump over 4 feet

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents subsidize his "career" to keep him out of the house
- Younger sister is in medical school, the clear favorite

### Friends
- Has "training partners" who are really just other guys who like filming each other
- No deep connections, everyone is a potential collaborator

### Romantic
- Single, tells everyone he's "married to the grind"
- Has never had a relationship last more than two months

### At the Hostel
- Immediately gravitates toward any group drinking on the rooftop
- Annoys experienced climbers with his gear talk and lack of actual knowledge
- Bonds with a group of Australian backpackers who egg him on

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 5 AM to film a sunrise "training montage" on the hostel's lower roof. Gets some decent footage of himself doing basic vaults. Feels invincible.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Sitting at dinner, the Australian group mentions a gap between the hostel and the next building. "I bet that's an easy send," Bryce says. They laugh. He doesn't realize they're laughing at him.

### Final Thoughts
"This is it. This is the shot that changes everything. Mom and Dad will finally understand. Everyone will finally see. I was born for th--"

### Last Words
"ARE YOU GETTING THIS?"
