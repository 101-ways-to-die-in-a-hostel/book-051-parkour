# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** La Casa del Cielo (The House of the Sky)
**Type:** Party / Rooftop Hostel
**Star Rating:** 3.5
**Price Range:** $18-35 per night

### History
Built in 1923 as a wealthy merchant's home during Cartagena's golden age. Converted to a hostel in 2008. The rooftop was originally a private terrace for parties; now it's the hostel's main attraction. Three previous injuries from rooftop incidents, all covered up with cash settlements.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Spanish Colonial with Caribbean influences, white-washed walls, terra cotta accents
- **Floors:** 6 floors (unusually tall for the old city)
- **Total beds:** 78 beds
- **Notable features:** 360-degree rooftop views, original tile work, narrow spiral staircases, crumbling charm

### Layout
```
Ground Floor:
- Reception (small desk, barely staffed)
- Common room with hammocks
- Kitchen (basic but functional)
- Courtyard with plunge pool

Floors 2-4:
- Mixed dormitories (6-12 beds)
- Shared bathrooms (questionable plumbing)

Floor 5:
- Private rooms
- "VIP" 4-bed dorm with AC

Floor 6/Rooftop:
- Open-air bar (unlicensed)
- Seating areas with cushions
- THE EDGE - north side with 8-foot gap to adjacent building
- Fire escape (rusted, decorative only)
```

### The Death Location (Specific)
The north edge of the rooftop, where a low wall (knee-height, crumbling) separates the hostel from an 8-foot gap to the adjacent abandoned building. The edge has been eroding for years. At night, with only string lights for illumination, the gap looks smaller than it is. The adjacent building's rooftop is actually 2 feet lower, making the jump deceptively possible-looking.

## The City

**City:** Cartagena de Indias
**Country:** Colombia
**Population:** ~1 million
**Known for:** Walled colonial old city, Caribbean beaches, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, bachelor parties, Instagram influencers

### Geography

- **Weather during story:** Peak dry season, 90F days, warm nights, occasional sea breeze

### Culture

- **Danger level:** Moderate - petty theft, occasional violent crime outside walls, but tourist zone well-protected

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Roosters (in the old city, inexplicably), church bells, street vendors setting up
- Afternoon: Reggaeton from every doorway, horse hooves on cobblestones, tour guide megaphones
- Night: Bass from clubs, laughter echoing off colonial walls, the rooftop bar's speakers
- Unique sounds: The specific creak of the sixth-floor fire escape, the crumble of old masonry

### Smells
- Hostel: Incense failing to cover mildew, sunscreen, stale beer on the rooftop
- Street: Fried plantains, horse manure, sea salt, fruit cart mangoes
- Specific to death location: Caribbean breeze, cigarette smoke, the dusty smell of old brick

### Textures
- Surfaces: Rough whitewashed walls, uneven tile floors, sticky bar tops
- Climate feel: Oppressive humidity that makes everything damp, sweat constant

### Tastes
- Local food: Arepas, ceviche, fresh fruit, aguardiente
- Hostel offerings: Weak coffee, toast, communal "family dinners" of rice and beans

### Visual Details
- Colors: White walls, blue sky, bougainvillea pink and orange, colonial yellow
- Light quality: Harsh Caribbean sun during day, romantic string lights at night
- Distinctive visuals: Narrow streets, ancient walls, ultra-modern tourists against historic backdrops

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Carlos "Charlie" Herrera
**Description:** 30s, perpetually tired, has seen everything, gave up caring about rules two years ago. Wears the same Cartagena FC jersey every day.
**Role in death:** Technically supposed to lock rooftop after 11 PM. Never does. Will feel guilty but not legally responsible.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria | Never goes to rooftop, says "bad energy" |
| Security | None | Position eliminated in budget cuts |
| Bar/Kitchen | Rotating volunteers | Guests who work for free beds |
| Manager | German (owner's nephew) | Rarely present, mainly handles bookings remotely |

### Staff Knowledge
Charlie has warned guests about the edge before, but in a joking way: "Don't jump to the other roof, okay?" He says it with a laugh that suggests it's a joke, not a real warning. He's heard rumors of a previous fall that was covered up, but doesn't know details.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Hungover recovery zone. Bodies in hammocks. Strong coffee and regret. Planning beach trips. The rooftop is empty and sun-blasted.

### Night Vibe
Pre-game central. The rooftop fills by 8 PM. By 10 PM, it's a full party. The edge becomes a photo spot, then a dare spot, then a danger zone. By midnight, anything seems possible.

### Guest Demographics
60% Americans and Europeans, 30% Australians and Kiwis, 10% South Americans. Age range 19-28. Split between gap year kids and young professionals "finding themselves."

### Reputation
Booking.com: 7.8/10 - "Amazing rooftop, questionable safety"
Hostelworld: 8.2/10 - "Best views in Cartagena, don't mind the occasional falling brick"
Word of mouth: "The rooftop is insane, just don't get too close to the edge"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Most guests take a taxi from the airport to the walled city, then navigate narrow streets on foot. The hostel entrance is unmarked except for a small sign.

### Check-in Process
Passport scan, pay for first night, given a bracelet that serves as key and bar tab. Quick speech about rules that no one listens to.

### Rules
1. No smoking inside (ignored)
2. Quiet after midnight (laughable)
3. Rooftop closes at 11 PM (never enforced)
4. No climbing on edges (signed waiver covers the hostel)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: decent)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers (small, cramped)
- [x] Laundry (drop-off service)
- [ ] Pool (plunge pool barely counts)
- [x] Bar
- [x] Rooftop
- [x] Tours offered (through partner agencies)
- [x] Other: "Free" walking tour, nightly pub crawl

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Cartagena's old city is UNESCO protected, building heights are restricted - this hostel is grandfathered in
- Colombian liability laws are murky for tourist establishments
- Rooftop bars are everywhere but rarely as unsupervised as this one

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Avoid stereotyping Colombian characters
- The danger here is from tourist culture, not local culture
- Drug references should be handled carefully

### Sources
- Cartagena tourism guides
- Hostel reviews from the area
- News stories about tourist accidents in Colombia
- Physics of falls and terminal velocity
